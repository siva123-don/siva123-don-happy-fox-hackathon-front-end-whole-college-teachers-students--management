Project Description: Front-End of a College Management System (with Auth Backend)
This is the front-end interface of a College Management System , built as part of a hackathon project. The application is designed to simplify administrative and academic workflows in educational institutions by providing an intuitive UI for students, faculty, and admins.

The front end has been developed using [insert framework/library if applicable â€“ e.g., React.js, Vue.js, HTML/CSS/JS] and currently integrates with a backend API only for user authentication , allowing users to sign up, log in, and access role-based dashboards securely.

Other features are implemented as static/mock interfaces , including:

Role-based dashboards (Student, Faculty, Admin)
Profile management
Attendance and result views (static data)
Course and timetable display
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
This project demonstrates a clean, modular, and scalable UI architecture that can be extended in the future with full backend integration for all modules.
